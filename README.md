# Sudoku - Solver
Using Backtracking algorith, I have solved a pre defined Sudoku puzzle.
The algorithm works something like this:
1. Pick empty box.
2. Try all numbers.
3. Find one that works.
4. Backtrack when the sudoku rules are broken.
5. Repeat the above steps until all the boxes are filled up.
